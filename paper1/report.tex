\begin{abstract}
Massive Open Online Education(MOOC) often refers to a kind of online course that emphasizes free and unrestricted access via the internet. This paper will focus on how to collect such data as length of study, learning time of the day, preferred courses and other learners' behaviors to analyze and make predictions for future course designers and online teaching platform administrators.

\section{Introduction}

Nowadays people in the field from K-12 to institutions of higher education have witnessed a great shift from traditional classroom teaching to distance learning. These online courses are based on Learning Management Systems (LMSs). The more advanced a learning management system could be, the better they could collect a variety of data from students' activities and performances. \cite{Cormier2010} With this amount of data, educators and researchers could utilize data mining and data visualization techniques to generated synchronous feedback and to keep-track of students' progress with higher efficiency. The source of the data could be the average time a student is learning a certain course, test score of a quiz, response rate in an online discussion session, etc. \cite{Klobas2010}

\section{Big Data and Education}
Big data are sometimes considered as the amount of data that could be available to an organization, in which contains a gigantic amount of information that would render itself too complex for any household data-processing software to manage. Not only big data emphasizes the amount of data, it also all calls for the need of real-time data and a wide source of data. As for the field of education, big data provide more direct evidence-based approach to learning and could allow researchers to see the difference of students nationwide or even worldwide. Analyzing these data could help LMS providers to make strategical improvements or let online teachers provide personalized tutoring to those student in need. \cite{Anderson2008}


\section{Educational Data Mining in MOOC}
Educational Data Mining (EDM) refers to the process of analyzing various kinds of data on diverse levels of education (for instance, data could be collected from online students to decision-makers of the MOOC corporation) via a variety of techniques and tools. \cite{Berland2014} What is collected includes time, sequence and context of the course being taught. It could be easily inferred that EDM requires cooperation of various subjects such as statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. With these interdisciplinary means data could be processed. 
EDM aims to predict the academic performance of a student, evaluate student learning in the context of LMS, improve instructional sequences and evaluate add-on software that could provide additional help with the LMS. Pioneers of this field are researching how to improve the modeling of student performance, teaching domain and LMS properties and characteristics.  They are also interested in providing students with diverse needs different track of learning courses accordingly. \Cite{Baker2009}
It is concluded that EDM usually requires five means to analyze educational data:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Prediction
   \item Clustering
   \item Relationship Mining
   \item Distillation of Data
   \item Discovery via Models
\end{enumerate}
Prediction stresses that students' academic performance will be analyzed via their behavior in online learning. Clustering means that by sensing such specific characteristics as preference of learning materials or performance styles, the students will be grouped according to the elements mentioned above. Moreover, these resources could be recommended to learners with similar needs. Relationship mining is the most mentioned method in EDM. It focuses on figuring out hidden relationships with such variables as teaching and learning strategies, students' performance in online environment and students' interactions. Distillation of data for human judgement concentrate on ways to filter out most important data in a cluster so that researcher could figure out structures in the data quickly. Discovery via models, the last method, focuses on utilizing existing model to analyzed newly collected data. \cite{Baker2009}
To better utilize EDM, the MOOC cooperation shall establish a data structure first by determining the need of its users and their learning goals as well as the source of the data. Then they shall start defining certain variables and start creating a model or choose from an existing one. In the end they could start using this model to predict students' preferences and make modification accordingly. It is stated in some research that after using EDM to collect more information, MOOC's learning outcomes are improved and course tutors could cater to students' needs more efficiently. \Cite{Berland2014}

\section{Learning Analytics}
Other than computer science and statistics, Learning Analytics (LAs) are rooted on a wider spectrum of subjects such as sociology and psychology. Those who applies LAs wish to create a learning environment for teachers in which each student's learning need will be satisfied to the greatest extent and they could also choose their own learning tracks via their own learning habits. LAs could also enable facilitator of MOOC to distribute educational resources with better decision-making mechanism, providing feedback to students and help at-risk students (refer to those who haven't participated in learning activities for a long time or those who do not have ideal performance in quizzes). \cite{Drachler2012}
To reach these goals mentioned above, LAs also involve a vast variety of data, from students' learning habits, assignments collected, social interaction online, threads on discussion forums to generate students' progress and identify those who might be at-risks. With enough data collected, LAs could also be utilized to determine the overall structure of the course, students' learning objectives and the sequence of learning contents. \Cite{Berland2014} Decisions are often based on models with multiple dimensions such as students' experience, knowledge, their preferred sequence of learning. 
LAs consist of three steps: Data collection and processing, analyzing data and action and data post processing. It can be concluded that LAs could be efficient for all level of users, tutors and decision-makers in MOOC however it also face lots of challenges as decision makers will need to determine what kind of data to collect and they need to connect separate collected data together via specific algorithm to gain a holistic view of inner connections between. \cite{spector2014}

\section{Discussions}
Although the application of big data in MOOC will bring convenience and efficiency to online teaching and learning, challenges are also lurking within the boundaries of ethical, researching and equality issues. 
\subsection{Ethical issues} 
Not only in the field of online education, the ethical aspect is a heated debate topic almost across any place that involves application of big data. For instance, privacy factor is perhaps the most discussed item about the era of big data. \cite{Manyika2011} As mentioned above, learning management system developers are designing course recommendation systems like online shopping websites. Website may push such messages to students as ``You scored well in this subject. According to our analysis, those who excel in this course are more likely to take this'' or ``You have taken these three courses in our row. We would recommend this course to you since it is in the same cohort.''
This does seem promising, however in real world such scenario might take place: Based on the pretest and history performance of a student, the system suggest that he/she is most likely to drop out of this course. Instead of supporting him/her to master this course (which might cost extra manpower), the staff of the education website might intentionally let him/her fail, only charging their tuition fee.\cite{Spector2013} One other issue is that with the implication of such recommendation system, students are more likely to follow the track set by the algorithm and the element of serendipity is deprived. Therefore, they cannot explore the field of knowledge freely. \cite{Robins1989}
\subsection{Issues in Research}
Although research could collect a greater variety of data nowadays in MOOC, it could not depict the full nature of online teaching and learning. Ergo the data we could collect determines the research directions and endeavors of MOOC. Researchers would build algorithm to study the pattern of online teaching, yet the data researchers failed to collect will become the missing variables or coefficients in the algorithm thus brings biased outcomes. Moreover, researching MOOC data requires a team with interdisciplinary backgrounds and cooperation of multiple organizations and institutions. It would take lots of negotiations and agreements to set up such cooperation. \cite{Boyd2012}
\subsection{Equality Issues}
MOOC data are collected from those who have access to internet which means that those who reside in area with underdeveloped cyberinfrastructure are not likely to be counted in the research. \cite{Eynon2012} On the other hand, some data are collected by organizations for profit and required certain amount of fee to retrieve. Thus, some researchers or non-profit organization may not have access to them. Such scenario is against the openness spirit in MOOC. 

\section{Conclusions}
With the rapid iteration of software and LMSs, learners nowadays could easily gain access to massive amount of learning materials at almost every corner of the world. MOOC brings great flexibility to learners so that they could choose their online instructors, their sequence of learning and their learning materials. It also brought instructors and students closer than ever so that they could interact more frequently, thus enabling a more dynamic atmosphere in learning. Challenges also arises as the numbers of students grow exponentially, it could be more difficult for teachers and managers to keep track of each student's status and provide help accordingly. Thanks to the introduction of big data in this field, decision maker of MOOC could evaluate and investigate students' status more easily and could develop more learning strategies. It can be envisioned that soon big data will relieve more burden on teachers' shoulders.
